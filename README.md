Powerful Disassembler Library For AMD64

Definition: A lightweight, Easy-to-Use and Fast Disassembler/Decomposer Library for x86/AMD64. A Decomposer means that you get a binary structure that describes an instruction rather than textual representation.

 diStorm3 includes the following new features:

    Access to CPU flags that were affected by the instruction.
    New API for instruction decomposition.
    Basic Flow Control analysis support.
    AVX and FMA instruction sets support.
    Complete documentation and code samples.
    Some bug fixes and massive code refactoring.

diStorm3 also supports:

    Minimal API for decode and decompose, no initialization is required.
    Decode modes: 16, 32 and 64 bits.
    Instruction Sets: FPU, MMX, SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4, 
      3DNow! (w/ extensions), new x86-64, VMX and AMD's SVM.

    Reentrancy (multi-threaded).
    Platform independent - Windows, Linux and Mac. Little/big endianity. User/kernel mode.
    Different compilers (GCC, MSVC). Can be used either statically or dynamically.
    Java and Python wrappers.
